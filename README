A (currently incomplete) flip pad. Scribble something, add a new page
then scribble again.

Should remind you of scribbling on multiple pages of a post-it note pack,
then quickly flipping through to see the "animation".

Python 2.x and Pygame.

Windows build is in flippy_pad_windows.zip. Created with py2exe. Tested on XP and 7.
